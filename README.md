**Stuttering Detection Application (Arabic Speech)**  
*(Freelancing Project)*  

---

## **Overview**  
ABGD is a responsive application designed to detect stuttering in Arabic speech using **advanced audio analysis** and **deep learning**. It enables real-time classification of speech into **stuttering**, **normal speech**, or **noise**, achieving **96% accuracy** with a CNN model trained on a dataset collected from **70+ individuals**.  

The app also provides **secure storage** for test results and collaborates with psychologists to create **age-specific, personalized therapy plans** for users.

## **Key Features**  
- Real-time speech classification into stuttering, normal speech, or noise.  
- **96% accuracy** with a CNN model trained on 70+ individuals.  
- Secure storage for test results and progress tracking.  
- Age-specific therapy plans designed by psychologists.  
- User-friendly interface with smooth animations.

## **Toolkits & Technologies**  
- **Frontend:** Flutter (`flutter_audio_capture`, `flutter_pdfview`, `lottie`, `http`).  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow.  
- **Database & Storage:** Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Auth).  
- **Data Science:** MFCCs, Spectrograms, STFT for feature extraction.  
- **Model Optimization:** Early Stopping, ModelCheckpoint, Weighted Majority Voting, L2 Regularization.  
- **Deployment:** Microsoft Azure (scalability, high availability, secure data storage).

## **How It Works**  
1. Users record audio files in Arabic.  
2. The app preprocesses the audio using **MFCCs, Spectrograms, and STFT**.  
3. The **CNN model** analyzes the audio and classifies it into stuttering, normal speech, or noise.  
4. Results are securely stored, and users can track progress or access personalized therapy plans.
